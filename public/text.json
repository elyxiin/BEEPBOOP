      "Converting from a gas cooktop to an electric cooktop is the easiest and cheapest of changes to decarbonize your home. Gas cooktops degrade air quality, leading to higher risks of asthma and respiratory illnesses - nothing I would like around my home. \n \n Whether you switch to an induction cooktop or a conventional electric cooktop, the change will be a step towards modernizing your kitchen and enhancing your kitchen experience.",
      "Induction cooktops are engineered with safety in mind. Unlike traditional gas stoves, an induction cooktop activated without cookware remains relatively cool. This is no oversight; It is an intentional design feature. Heat is generated directly within the cookware through electric pulses, ensuring the cooktop itself stays much cooler compared to the surface of a gas stove. \n \n Despite the heat generated on the cooktop itself being lower, the time to properly heat up the cookware is quicker and the temperature is more accurate.",
      "Induction cooktops require complementary cookware - cookware that only works with magnetic metals such as cast iron, carbon steel and stainless steel. Electric cooktops are compatible with any type of cookware. Electric cooktops also hold an advantage for users who want to stick to something more similar to the gas stove. \n \n Induction cooktops are far more energy efficient than gas stoves and a little more energy efficient than electric cooktops, saving money for induction cooktop users. However, the prices of electric cooktops tend to be lower than that of induction cooktops, making it a more viable option for potential buyers."

      "A hybrid water heater, often referred to as a “heat pump water heater,” is a completely electric method of water heating. It transfers heat from the surrounding air to heat water, making it highly energy-efficient. Government and utility incentives, including rebates and tax credits, are available to encourage adoption. However, hybrid water heaters rely on the climate to heat water, making them best suited for mild climates where sufficient heat can be extracted from the air.",
      "In contrast, traditional electric water heaters use resistive heating, directly converting electrical energy into heat to warm water. They can be adopted across a wider range of areas. However, on most occasions, electric water heaters can be more pricey on the installation and on the electric bill."

      "This is an air-source heat pump, the most common type of heat pump. It transfers heat between the house and the outside air. Deceptive to their name, modern heat pumps can both heat and cool your home. While most heat pumps perform best in mild climates, new technologies are emerging to accommodate colder regions. The other relatively common type of heat pump is the geothermal heat pump, which uses consistent temperature of the Earth to regulate temperatures in the home.",
      "Heat pumps come in two primary configurations: ductless mini-splits and ducted systems.",
      "Mini split systems control individual room temperatures, with each room requiring its own air handler. These systems are easier to install, making them a great option for homes that are not compatible with traditional HVAC systems - no tearing apart of the house needed. Ducted systems also have a reputation for losing energy; Ductless systems can avoid this downside. ",
      "For many, individual room temperature control may be a selling point for ductless heat pumps. However, it can also work conversely: homeowners may want universal control over the temperature of their home.  A ducted system controls the temperature of the entire house. Ducted systems can also be easily added to homes with existing ductwork, making them a practical option for many."

      "Unless solar panels provide you all the energy you need, you’re getting your energy from the grid. An electricity grid is an interconnected network designed to deliver electricity.",
      "Energy is produced at power plants and is sent into the grid. The method of electricity generation you receive is a mix of all the energies released into the grid. If you want to know NY's energy production breakdown, you can access it <a href='https://www.nyiso.com/single-chart-page?chart=currentFuel&chartpopup=true' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
      "To ensure you are putting in as much clean energy as you are using into the grid, you can sign up for community solar. Community solar enables individuals, businesses and organizations to benefit from solar energy without installing panels onto their own homes. The company will produce electricity through solar panels on their property for you.In the vast majority of cases, community solar participants are just buying electricity at a cheaper rate. For most communities, community solar is easily accessible and easy to sign up for."

      "Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Solar panels do not need the burning of fossil fuels, the water consumption of coal and nuclear plants to cool, nor do they emit air pollutants. \n \n Solar panels are a long-term investment. As the years fly by, the price of going solar is getting cheaper. Their upfront cost may look heavy, but you can find yourself cutting the prices through a variety of methods.",
      "As of 2024, the federal government offers a tax credit for residential solar installations. The credit can be up to 30% of the total cost of the solar system, including installation. More information about federal tax credit can be found <a href='https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
      "Many states and local governments provide additional incentives to encourage adopting solar. In New York, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers <a href='https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/NY-Sun/Contractors/Dashboards-and-incentives' target='_blank'> many incentives</a> including low-interest loans which can be added to your monthly electric bill. \n \n In some states, net metering policies allow homeowners to receive credits for any excess electricity generated by their solar panels. During the day when solar panels are generating more energy than needed, the surplus is sent to the grid in exchange for credits. The credits offset the electricity drawn from the grid during the night, cloudy days or storms when energy production is less abundant.",
      "Some utility companies offer rebates or incentives for the installation of solar panels. The programs can vary widely depending on location. Contacting your utility company directly or visiting their website to learn about any available programs can help offset costs."
